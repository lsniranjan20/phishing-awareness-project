# Phishing Awareness Simulation Using Flask

This is a **cybersecurity awareness project** that demonstrates how phishing attacks work using a safe local demo.  
The project uses a **fictional social media login page** to show how users can unknowingly submit credentials to a fake page and highlights risks of using **insecure networks** like public Wi-Fi.

**Important:** This project is for educational purposes only. No real user credentials are collected.
